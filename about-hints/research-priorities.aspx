                    <h1>HINTS Contributions to DCCPS Research Priorities</h1>

                    <p>In 2022, NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) identified and unveiled <a href="https://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/research-emphasis/future-directions">six key research priorities</a> representing areas where immediate and intensified focus could significantly accelerate scientific progress and increase the impact of DCCPS-sponsored research. These six priority areas include 1) digital health, 2) climate change, 3) modifiable risk factors, 4) health equity, 5) evidence-based cancer control policy, and 6) data strategies. HINTS plays a critical role in informing and advancing each of these key areas and is an important resource for the division in seeking to meet the goals outlined under each priority topic.</p>

                    <p><em>Identify and intervene upon modifiable risk factors, alone and in combination, to prevent cancer across the life course, and among cancer survivors, to improve treatment response and health outcomes.</em></p>

                    <h2>Health Equity</h2>

                    <p><em>Promote cancer control research that leads to equitable and optimal health outcomes for all populations.</em></p>

                    <p>HINTS includes several items that can help researchers monitor and examine the prevalence, predictors, and impacts of health disparities. For example, in addition to standard demographic items, recent HINTS surveys have asked respondents about social determinants of health (e.g., food insecurity, experiences with discrimination).</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li class="li_spacing"><a href="/view-questions/question-detail.aspx?PK_Cycle=14&qid=1896">In the past 12 months, how often were the following things true?

                    </ul>

                    <p>Furthermore, the HINTS program provides linked datasets that can facilitate the examination of contextual, environmental, and social factors that may contribute to health disparities. The <a href="/data/survey-instruments.aspx#HDLP2020">HINTS Data Linkage Project</a> links HINTS data with external variables such as income inequality, median household income, and residential segregation. </p>

                    <p><em>Evaluate existing policies and inform future policies that impact optimal approaches for cancer prevention, control, care, and outcomes.</em></p>

                    <p>HINTS has included several health policy-related questions over the years, including items assessing public support for various cancer control policies (such as warning label requirements), as well as items monitoring the impact of newly enacted policies (such as menu labeling regulations).</p>

                    <p><em>Develop innovative strategies to efficiently and ethically collect, analyze, share, and reuse data to fill information gaps and accelerate research that will reduce the cancer burden.</em></p>

                    <p>The data strategies priority area focuses on accelerating research through collecting, analyzing, sharing, and reusing data. HINTS contributes to this priority area by making its <a href="/data/default.aspx">datasets publicly available</a> to researchers and practitioners, and by developing innovative datasets that enable more advanced analyses. For example, the <a href="/data/survey-instruments.aspx#HDLP2020">HINTS Data Linkage Project</a> contains geo-coded HINTS data linked at the county level with over 70 external variables (e.g., number of Federally Qualified Health Centers, percent of households with broadband internet) from sources such as US Census and USDA to help answer important questions about area-level influences on cancer prevention and control.</p>
