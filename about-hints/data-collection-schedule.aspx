                    <h1>HINTS 5 Overview and Schedule</h1>
                    <p>
                        To address emerging issues in the field of health communication more
                 quickly while still maintaining the ongoing measurement of trends, 
                HINTS 5 will include four data collection cycles over the course of
                 4 years. The instrument for each data collection cycle will include 
                a core module of common items for trending in addition to special topic
                 modules to be implemented only in some of the cycles, increasing capacity
                 of the HINTS instruments to include a broader array of topics and measures.
                 Additionally, a second cycle of HINTS-FDA will be fielded in 2017. The
                 combined sample size for all four cycles of HINTS 5 and additional cycle of
                 HINTS-FDA data will be greater than 17,000 respondents. If you would like
                 to view or download previous HINTS survey instruments or methodology reports,
                 please visit our <a href="/data/survey-instruments.aspx">Survey Instruments page</a>. HINTS
                 5 instruments will be coming soon.
