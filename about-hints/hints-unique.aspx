                    <p>The National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) is the only nationally representative, federally funded survey that includes items related to health and cancer communication, information technology, and the information environment in addition to items related to health-related knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. This communication and technology focus allows researchers to monitor changes in the health communication environment and study the impact of communication on key processes affecting the health of American adults.</p>
