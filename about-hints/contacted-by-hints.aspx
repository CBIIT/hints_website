                    <h1>Were You Contacted to Participate in HINTS?</h1>

                    <p>Congratulations on being selected to participate in the Health Information National Trends Survey, also known as HINTS! The goal of HINTS is to learn what health information people want to know and where they go to find it. Tens of thousands of people across the United States have participated in HINTS since 2003.</p>
                    <p>
                        By completing the questionnaire you received, you will help us learn what health information you and your family need and how to make it available to you.<br />
                    </p>
                    <p>In previous HINTS surveys, we learned that:</p>
                    <ul type="disc">
                        <li>Over 70% of adults in America agree that &lsquo;there are so many different recommendations about preventing cancer, it's hard to know which ones to follow.&rsquo;</li>
                        <li>27% of adults in America used wearable devices like Fitbits and Apple Watches to monitor their health in the past year and over 70% of them use the device to track their health every day or almost every day. </li>
                        <li>About one third of adults in America (34%) are not sure whether e-cigarettes are more or less harmful than regular cigarettes. </li>
                        <li>About half of adults in America (47%) reported trying to lose weight in the past year </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>To make sure HINTS provides accurate information, we need all the households that are invited to participate to complete the questionnaire, so if you have not sent in your questionnaire, we encourage you to do so!</p>
