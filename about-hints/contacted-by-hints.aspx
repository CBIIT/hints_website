    <h1>Were You Contacted to Participate in HINTS?</h1>
    <p>Congratulations on being selected to participate in the Health Information National Trends Survey, also known as HINTS! The goal of HINTS is to learn what health information people want to know and where they go to find it. Almost 20,000 people across the United States have participated in HINTS so far.</p>
    <p>In previous HINTS surveys we learned that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>About 80 percent of adults are not sure which recommendations about nutrition to follow</li>
        <li>Nearly 50 percent of adults don’t know the age at which to begin screening for certain types of cancer</li>
        <li>Americans are <i>less trustful</i> of the health information they obtain from online sources</li>
    </ul>
    <p>By completing this questionnaire, you will help us learn what health information you and your family need and how to make it available to you. To make sure HINTS provides accurate information, we need all the households invited to participate in this year’s HINTS to complete the survey, so if you have not sent in your questionnaire, we encourage you to do so!</p>
    <p>Your participation is voluntary, and your responses will be kept private under the Privacy Act of 1974. Your answers cannot be connected to your name or any other information that could identify you or your household, to the extent provided by law.
