                    <p>HINTS 6 (2022) data were collected from March through November 2022. HINTS 6 (2022) consisted of two modes, with respondents being offered a paper survey or web option.</p>
                    <p>The sampling strategy for HINTS 6 (2022) consisted of a two-stage design. In the first stage, a stratified sample of addresses was selected from a file of residential addresses. In the second stage, one adult was selected within each sampled household. The sampling frame consisted of a database of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to provide random samples of addresses. A total of 6,252 surveys were included in the final dataset. </p>
                    <p>HINTS 6 (2022) included an embedded methodological experiment comparing two mixed mode approaches: concurrent and sequential (also known as the control and treatment groups). Households in the concurrent (control) group received a cover letter with the link to the web survey and their unique access code as well as a paper survey with each mailing (including their first mailing). Households in the sequential (treatment) group received only a cover letter with the link to the web survey and their unique access code with their first mailing—they did not receive a paper survey in their first mailing. In subsequent mailings, these households received the link to the web survey and their unique access code as well as the paper survey. </p>

                    <p>
                        In 2021, NCI undertook a pilot project to oversample cancer survivors for HINTS using three cancer registries from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program (<a target="_blank" href="https://seer.cancer.gov">https://seer.cancer.gov</a>) as a sampling frame of cancer survivors. The pilot project, called HINTS-SEER, was designed to provide a larger sample of cancer survivors for HINTS analyses. The instrument closely resembles survey items and topics found on HINTS 5, Cycle 4 (2020), and includes other topics relevant to cancer survivors. A unique aspect of the HINTS-SEER dataset is that key data elements from the cancer registry datasets are linked to the HINTS survey responses, providing a more in-depth view of each respondent&rsquo;s cancer diagnosis.
                    </p>
                    <p>HINTS-SEER data were collected from January 11, 2021 through August 20, 2021. Once the SEER registries obtained consent to share individual mailing addresses, the mailing protocol for all three HINTS-SEER cohorts (Iowa Cancer Registry, Greater Bay Area Cancer Registry, and New Mexico Tumor Registry) followed a modified Dillman approach (Dillman, et al., 2009) with a total of four mailings: an initial mailing, a reminder postcard, and two follow-up mailings. Individuals in each sample received the first mailing and reminder postcard, while only non-respondents received the subsequent survey mailings. Complete data were collected from 1,234 respondents.</p>

                    <p>The HINTS Data Linkage Project 2020 (HDLP) contains geo-coded, restricted, HINTS 5 Cycle 4 data (2020; n = 3,865) linked—at the county level-- with over 70 external variables chosen from trusted and reliable sources including the US Census, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA). The external variables fall into five categories: 1) Social and economic factors (e.g., Income inequality); 2) Demographics (e.g., Percent of population 65 or older); 3) Information technology (e.g., Percent of households with broadband internet); 4) Built environment (e.g., Fitness centers and recreational sports per 100,000 people); and 5) Physical environment (e.g., Percentage of days with good air quality). Given the geocodes and potential for disclosure, the HDLP is not a public-use data file and anyone interested in accessing the data will first need to <a href="/data/restricted-data.aspx">apply to access the data via the HINTS restricted-use data request form</a>.</p>

                    <p>The sample design for the HINTS 4, Cycle 3 (2013) survey consisted of two-stages. In the first stage, a stratified sample of addresses was selected from a file of residential addresses. In the second-stage, one adult was selected within each sampled household. The sampling frame consisted of a database of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG) to provide random samples of addresses. Complete data were collected from 3,185 respondents.</p>

                        HINTS 4, Cycle 1 (2011) data were collected from October 2011 through February 2012. The sample design for HINTS 4, Cycle 1 (2011) consisted of a single-mode mail survey, with two methods of respondent selection: the “All Adult” method and the “Next Birthday” method. The sampling consisted of a two-stage stratified sample of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG).

                    <p>Two methods of respondent selection were used for  HINTS 4, Cycle 1 (2011): the “All Adult” method and the “Next Birthday” method. In the All Adult method, two questionnaires were sent with each mailing, where all adults residing in a sampled household were asked to complete the questionnaire. In the next birthday method, one questionnaire was sent with each mailing so that the adult who would have the next birthday in the sampled household was asked to complete the questionnaire. Data were collected from 3,959 respondents.</p>

                        The University of Puerto Rico Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Puerto Rico Behavioral Risk Factors Surveillance System, and the U.S. National Cancer Institute, implemented HINTS in Puerto Rico in 2009. A total of 639 (603 complete and 36 partially complete) interviews were conducted. Documentation is available to assist with analyzing the HINTS Puerto Rico data, including instructions on how to combine the dataset with HINTS 2007 for comparisons.

                    <p>
                        HINTS 3 (2008) data were collected from January 2008 through May 2008.  The sample design for HINTS 3 (2008) consisted of two samples with each sample selected from a separate sample frame. One sample was drawn as a Random Digit Dial telephone survey, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) format. The CATI survey for HINTS 3 (2008) was conducted using the same methodology as HINTS 2 and 1.  Survey administration averaged 30 minutes per respondent.  Data were collected from 4,092  respondents via CATI.
                    </p>
                    <p>The second national random sample was selected from a list of addresses from the United States Postal Service administrative records. After the CATI instrument was modified to produce a printed questionnaire, the survey and a cover letter were sent to the address sample.  All adults at each sampled address were asked to fill out the questionnaire and return it in a postage-paid envelope.  Data were collected from 3,582 respondents via mail.</p>

                        The first collection of HINTS data was conducted from October 2002 to April 2003. This initial data collection effort was fielded as a Random Digit Dial telephone survey, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) format to accommodate complex skip-patterns. Telephone numbers were generated at random from a sampling frame of all telephone exchanges throughout the 50 United States. Numbers were submitted to a telephone matching service to remove nonresidential numbers, where feasible, before calling. Screening calls were then placed to households. Interviewers followed an on-screen sampling algorithm to select a single sampled person from all adults 18 years and older in the household.  Survey administration averaged 30 minutes per respondent. Data were collected from 6,369 respondents.  See the Final Report link below for more information about the design, testing, and implementation of the HINTS 2003 survey.
