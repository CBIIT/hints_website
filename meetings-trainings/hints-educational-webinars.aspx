    <h2>How-To HINTS: A Practical Workshop</h2>


    <p>On May 4, 2016, presenters from the National Cancer  Institute and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration came together to provide an  overview of HINTS, review optimal ways for analyzing HINTS data, and present  case studies that used HINTS data in an interactive workshop and webinar.  Videos from this webinar are found below.</p>
    <p>Dr. Brad Hesse of the National Cancer  Institute (NCI) presents an introduction to the Health Information National  Trends Survey (HINTS) during the May 4th event &ldquo;How-To HINTS: A  Practical Workshop&rdquo;. This presentation reviews the history and goals of the  HINTS program, discusses the HINTS sampling methodology, and the strengths and  limitations of HINTS data.</p>
