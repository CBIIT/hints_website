        <a name="what"></a><strong>What HINTS Does</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        HINTS collects nationally representative data routinely about the American public's
            use of cancer-related information. The survey:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Provides updates on changing patterns, needs, and information opportunities in health</li>
        <li>Identifies changing communications trends and practices</li>
        <li>Assesses cancer information access and usage</li>
        <li>Provides information about how cancer risks are perceived</li>
        <li>Offers a testbed to researchers to test new theories in health
                communication </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        <a name="how"></a><strong>How HINTS Data Are Used</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The HINTS data collection program was created to monitor changes in the rapidly
            evolving field of health communication. Survey researchers are using the data to
            understand how adults 18 years and older use different communication channels, including
            the Internet, to obtain vital health information for themselves and their loved
            ones. Program planners are using the data to overcome barriers to health information
            usage across populations, and obtaining the data they need to create more effective
            communication strategies. Finally, social scientists are using the data to refine
            their theories of health communication in the information age and to offer new and
            better recommendations for reducing the burden of cancer throughout the population.
            Hints data are available for public use.
